of reference Physics Lists is not small, because there are many alternative physics models in the toolkit applicable for simulation of very different problems. Reference Physics Lists are available in GEANT4 physics_list sub-library. All these classes inherit from virtual interface G4VModularPhysicsList (which is an extention of the base class G4VUserPhysicsList. The advantages of the modular design are in maintenence of modules by different GEANT4 working groups, independent development of particular modules, possibility for combining of various modules (following G4VPhysicsConstructor interface) in reference Physics Lists and in user custom Physics Lists. There are following types of modules:electromagnetic physics;\n\nextra physics processes for gamma and leptons;\n\ndecay;\n\nhadron elastic;\n\nhadron inelastic;\n\nstopping particles capture processes;\n\nion nuclear interactions;\n\nstep limiters;\n\nothers.\n\nThe generalization and abstraction of physics processes is a key issue in the design of Geant4. All physics processes are treated in the same manner from the tracking point of view. The Geant4 approach enables anyone to create a process and assign it to a particle type. This openness should allow the creation of processes for novel, domain-specific or customised purposes by individuals or groups of users.Each process has two groups of methods which play an important role in tracking, GetPhysicalInteractionLength (GPIL) and DoIt. The GPIL method gives the step length from the current space-time point to the next space-time point. It does this by calculating the probability of interaction based on the process’s cross section information. At the end of this step the DoIt method should be invoked. The DoIt method implements the details of the interaction, changing the particle’s energy, momentum, direction and position, and producing secondary tracks if required. These changes are recorded as G4VParticleChange objects (see Particle change).\n\n\n"},"PhysicsProcesses/Electromagnetic.html":{"url":"PhysicsProcesses/Electromagnetic.html","title":"Electromagnetic","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nElectromagnetic这里只介绍中低能实验核物理模拟需要用到的，粒子物理中的部分这里不给出说明A description of the various electromagnetic physics constructors and their effects on the simulation performance both in terms of computation (CPU) and physics precision.http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/PhysicsListGuide/html/index.html文献：2011\nRecent Improvements in Geant4 Electromagnetic Physics Models and Interfaces\n\n\nThe default electromagnetic physics is built by the G4EmStandardPhysics constructor (see details in EM Opt0).\nIt is implemented for the following particles: γ, e−, e+, μ−, μ+, τ−, τ+, K+, K−, p, Σ+, Σ−, Ξ−, Ω−, anti(Σ+, Σ−, Ξ−, Ω−), d, t, 3He, α, anti(d, t, 3He, α), and G4GenericIon.Several charmed mesons are also treated, D+, D−, Ds+, Ds−, Λc+, Σc+, Σc++, Ξc+, anti(Λc+, Σc+, Σc++, Ξc++), as well as two bottom mesons, B+ and B−.Internal tables for energy loss, range and cross sections are built from 100 eV to 100 TeV. These limits are defined\nbased on LHC experiments requirements. Upper limits of applicability of various electromagnetic processes are larger\nand are process dependent. For example, muon models are valid up to 1 PeV. In order to provide particle transport\nfor all use-cases, the operational energy range goes down to zero but below 1 keV the accuracy of the default set of\nmodels is degraded substantially.The GEANT4 toolkit includes many alternative physics models, especially, for electromagnetic physics. There are\nseveral well established configurations recommended for different applications:G4EmStandardPhysics_option1 EM Opt1 - extention name EMV;\nG4EmStandardPhysics_option2 EM Opt2 - extention name EMX;\nG4EmStandardPhysics_option3 EM Opt3 - extention name EMY;\nG4EmStandardPhysics_option4 EM Opt4 - extention name EMZ;\nG4EmLivermorePhysics EM Liv - extention name LIV;\nG4EmPenelopePhysics EM Pen - extention name PEN;\nG4EmStandardPhysics_GS EM GS - extention name _GS;\nG4EmStandardPhysics_SS EM SS\nEM Opt0This physics list uses “standard” GEANT4 electromagnetic physics as built by the G4EmStandardPhysics constructor. It is implemented for the following particles: γ, e−, e+, p, d, t, 3He, α, anti(d,t,3He,α), and G4GenericIon.Processes cover physics from 0 to 100 TeV for gamma, e− and e+ and up to 1 PeV for muons. EM interactions of\ncharged hadrons and ions cover the range 0 to 100 TeV. Though the operational energy range goes down to zero, below\n1 keV accuracy of these models is substantially lower.For each particle type Standard EM models implement several processes.Photons:e−/e+ pair production is implemented by the BetheHeitler model with the LPM effect at high energies and\n\nCompton scattering is implemented by the Klein-Nishina model.\n\nPhoto-electric effect and Rayleigh scattering are both handled by the Livermore models.\n\n\nElectrons and positrons:multiple Coulomb scattering is handled by the Urban model from 0 to 100 MeV and by the WentzelVI model from 100 MeV to 100 TeV, which is combined with the single Coulomb scattering model, which is\napplied for large angle scattering.\n\nBremsstrahlung is implemented by the eBremSB model and the eBremLPM model which takes into account the LPM effect at high energies.\n\nIonization is modeled by the Moller-Bhabha formulation, and positron annihilation is implemented by the eplus2gg model.\n\n\nprotons and anti-protons:multiple Coulomb scattering is performed by the WentzelVI model and Coulomb scattering by the eCoulombScattering model.\n\nBremsstrahlung is handled by hBrem model.\n\nIonization is handled by several models depending on energy and particle type.\n\nFor protons, the Bragg model is used below 2 MeV and the BetheBloch above.\n\nFor anti-protons ICRU73Q0 is used below 2 MeV and BetheBloch above.\n\n\nalpha and G4GenericIon: only two EM processes are applied.Multiple Coulomb scattering in implemented by the Urban model at all energies.\n\nFor alphas Bragg ionization is performed below 7.9 MeV and BetheBloch ionization above.\n\nFor generic ions, Bragg is used below 2 MeV and BetheBloch above.\n\n\nEM Opt1Though the operational energy range goes down to zero, below 1 keV accuracy of these models is substantially lower.For each particle type Standard EM models implement several processes.Photons:e−/e+ pair production is implemented by the BetheHeitler model with the LPM effect at high energies and\n\nCompton scattering is implemented by the Klein-Nishina model.\n\nPhoto-electric effect and Rayleigh scattering are both handled by the Livermore models.\n\n\nElectrons and positrons:multiple Coulomb scattering is handled by the Urban model from 0 to 100 MeV and by the WentzelVI model from 100 MeV to 100 TeV, which is combined with the single Coulomb scattering model, which is applied for large angle scattering.\n\nBremsstrahlung is implemented by the eBremSB model and the eBremLPM model which takes into account the LPM effect at high energies.\n\nIonization is modeled by the Moller-Bhabha formulation, and positron annihilation is implemented by the eplus2gg model.\n\n\nprotons and anti-protons:multiple Coulomb scattering is performed by the WentzelVI model and Coulomb scattering by the eCoulombScattering model.\n\nBremsstrahlung is handled by hBrem model.\n\ne−/e+ pair production by hadrons is implemented by the hPairProduction model.\n\nIonization is handled by several models depending on energy and particle type.\n\nFor protons, the Bragg model is used below 2 MeV and the BetheBloch above.\n\nFor anti-protons ICRU73Q0 is used below 2 MeV and BetheBloch above.\n\n\nalpha and G4GenericIon: only two EM processes are applied.Multiple Coulomb scattering in implemented by the Urban model at all energies.\n\nFor alphas Bragg ionization is performed below 7.9 MeV and BetheBloch ionization above.\n\nFor generic ions, Bragg is used below 2 MeV and BetheBloch above.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"PhysicsProcesses/Hadronic.html":{"url":"PhysicsProcesses/Hadronic.html","title":"Hadronic","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nHadronic电子在 Si 上截面数据 G4EMLOW7.3/microelecG4MicroElecCrossSectionDataSet.hh\n\nG4MicroElecElastic.hh\n\nG4MicroElecElasticModel.hhGeant4 physics processes for microdosimetry simulation: very low energy electromagnetic models for electrons in Si, NIM B, vol. 288, pp. 66 - 73, 2012.\n\n\nG4MicroElecInelastic.hh\nG4MicroElecInelasticModel.hh\nInelastic cross-sections of low energy electrons in silicon for the simulation of heavy ion tracks with theGeant4-DNA toolkit, NSS Conf.

While neutrino-induced reactions are not currently provided, the Geant4 hadronic framework is general enough to include their future implementation as a hybrid of weak and hadronic models.The general scheme followed is to factor the full interaction into an electromagnetic (or weak) vertex, in which a virtual particle is generated, and a hadronic vertex in which the virtual particle interacts with a target nucleus. In most cases the hadronic vertex is implemented by an existing Geant4 model which handles the intra-nuclear propagation.The cross sections for these processes are parameterizations, either directly of data or of theoretical distributions determined from the integration of lepton-nucleon cross sections double differential in energy loss and momentum transfer.For the most part gammas can be treated as hadrons and in fact they interact that way with the nucleus when the Bertini-style cascade G4CascadeInterface and QGSP models are used. These models may be assigned to G4PhotoNuclearProcess as shown in the following partial code:G4TheoFSGenerator* theHEModel = new G4TheoFSGenerator;\nG4QGSModel* theStringModel = new G4QGSModel;\nG4ExcitedStringDecay* theStringDecay =\n  new G4ExcitedStringDecay(theFragmentation=new G4QGSMFragmentation);\ntheStringModel->SetFragmentationModel(theStringDecay);\n\ntheHEModel->SetHighEnergyGenerator(theStringModel);\ntheHEModel->SetTransport(new G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface);\ntheHEModel->SetMinEnergy(8*GeV);\n\nG4CascadeInterface* theLEModel = new G4CascadeInterface;\ntheLEModel->SetMaxEnergy(10*GeV);\n\nG4PhotoNuclearProcess* thePhotoNuclearProcess = new G4PhotoNuclearProcess;\nthePhotoNuclearProcess->RegisterMe(theLEModel);\nthePhotoNuclearProcess->RegisterMe(theHEModel);\n\nG4ProcessManager* procMan = G4Gamma::Gamma()->GetProcessManager();\nprocMan->AddDiscreteProcess(thePhotoNuclearProcess);\nElectro-nuclear reactions in Geant4 are handled by the classes G4ElectronNuclearProcess and G4PositronNuclearProcess, which are both implmented by G4ElectroVDNuclearModel. This model consists of three sub-models: code which generates the virtual photon from the lepton-nucleus vertex, the Bertini-style cascade to handle the low and medium energy photons, and the FTFP model to handle the high energy photons.Muon-nuclear reactions are handled similarly. The process G4MuonNuclearProcess can be assigned the G4MuonVDNuclearModel which in turn is implemented by three sub-models: virtual gamma generation code, Bertini-style cascade and the FTFP model.\n\n\n"},"PhysicsProcesses/OpticalPhoton.html":{"url":"PhysicsProcesses/OpticalPhoton.html","title":"Optical Photon","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nOpticalPhotonhttp://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/TrackingAndPhysics/physicsProcess.html#optical-photon-processesA photon is considered to be optical when its wavelength is much greater than the typical atomic spacing. In Geant4 optical photons are treated as a class of particle distinct from their higher energy gamma cousins. This implementation allows the wave-like properties of electromagnetic radiation to be incorporated into the optical photon process. Because this theoretical description breaks down at higher energies, there is no smooth transition as a function of energy between the optical photon and gamma particle classes.For the simulation of optical photons to work correctly in Geant4, they must be imputed a linear polarization. This is unlike most other particles in Geant4 but is automatically and correctly done for optical photons that are generated as secondaries by existing processes in Geant4. Not so, if the user wishes to start optical photons as primary particles. In this case, the user must set the linear polarization using particle gun methods, the General Particle Source, or his/her PrimaryGeneratorAction. For an unpolarized source, the linear polarization should be sampled randomly for each new primary photon.The Geant4 catalogue of processes at optical wavelengths includes refraction and reflection at medium boundaries, bulk absorption, Mie and Rayleigh scattering. Processes which produce optical photons include the Cerenkov effect and scintillation. Optical photons are generated in Geant4 without energy conservation and their energy must therefore not be tallied as part of the energy balance of an event.The optical properties of the medium which are key to the implementation of these types of processes are stored as entries in a G4MaterialPropertiesTable which is linked to the G4Material in question. These properties may be constants or they may be expressed as a function of the photon’s energy. This table is a private data member of the G4Material class. The G4MaterialPropertiesTable is implemented as a hash directory, in which each entry consists of a value and a key. The key is used to quickly and efficiently retrieve the corresponding value. All values in the dictionary are either instantiations of G4double or the class G4MaterialPropertyVector, and all keys are of type G4String.A G4MaterialPropertyVector is a typedef of G4PhysicsOrderedFreeVector. The entries are a pair of numbers, which in the case of an optical property, are the photon energy and corresponding property value. It is possible for the user to add as many material (optical) properties to the material as he wishes using the methods supplied by the G4MaterialPropertiesTable class. In this example the interpolation of the G4MaterialPropertyVector is to be done by a spline fit. The default is a linear interpolation.// Optical properties added to a G4MaterialPropertiesTable and linked to a G4Material\nconst G4int NUMENTRIES = 32;\n\nG4double ppckov[NUMENTRIES] = {2.034*eV, ......, 4.136*eV};\nG4double rindex[NUMENTRIES] = {1.3435, ......, 1.3608};\nG4double absorption[NUMENTRIES] = {344.8*cm, ......, 1450.0*cm];\n\nG4MaterialPropertiesTable* MPT = new G4MaterialPropertiesTable();\n\nMPT -> AddConstProperty(\"SCINTILLATIONYIELD\",100./MeV);\n\nMPT -> AddProperty(\"RINDEX\",ppckov,rindex,NUMENTRIES}->SetSpline(true);\nMPT -> AddProperty(\"ABSLENGTH\",ppckov,absorption,NUMENTRIES}->SetSpline(true);\n\nscintillator -> SetMaterialPropertiesTable(MPT);\nCerenkov EffectThe radiation of Cerenkov light occurs when a charged particle moves through a dispersive medium faster than the group velocity of light in that medium. Photons are emitted on the surface of a cone, whose opening angle with respect to the particle’s instantaneous direction decreases as the particle slows down. At the same time, the frequency of the photons emitted increases, and the number produced decreases. When the particle velocity drops below the local speed of light, the radiation ceases and the emission cone angle collapses to zero. The photons produced by this process have an inherent polarization perpendicular to the cone’s surface at production.The flux, spectrum, polarization and emission of Cerenkov radiation in the AlongStepDoIt method of the class G4Cerenkov follow well-known formulae, with two inherent computational limitations. The first arises from step-wise simulation, and the second comes from the requirement that numerical integration calculate the average number of Cerenkov photons per step. The process makes use of a G4PhysicsTable which contains incremental integrals to expedite this calculation. The Cerenkov process in Geant4 is limited to normally dispersive media, i.e., dn(E)/dE≥0.The time and position of Cerenkov photon emission are calculated from quantities known at the beginning of a charged particle’s step. The step is assumed to be rectilinear even in the presence of a magnetic field. The user may limit the step size by specifying a maximum (average) number of Cerenkov photons created during the step, using the SetMaxNumPhotonsPerStep(const G4int NumPhotons) method. The actual number generated will necessarily be different due to the Poissonian nature of the production. In the present implementation, the production density of photons is distributed evenly along the particle’s track segment, even if the particle has slowed significantly during the step. The step can also be limited with the SetMaxBetaChangePerStep method, where the argument is the allowed change in percent).The frequently very large number of secondaries produced in a single step (about 300/cm in water), compelled the idea in GEANT3.21 of suspending the primary particle until all its progeny have been tracked. Despite the fact that Geant4 employs dynamic memory allocation and thus does not suffer from the limitations of GEANT3.21 with its fixed large initial ZEBRA store, Geant4 nevertheless provides for an analogous functionality with the public method SetTrackSecondariesFirst.// Registration of the Cerenkov process in PhysicsList.¶\n#include \"G4Cerenkov.hh\"\n\nvoid ExptPhysicsList::ConstructOp(){\n\n  G4Cerenkov*   theCerenkovProcess = new G4Cerenkov(\"Cerenkov\");\n\n  G4int MaxNumPhotons = 300;\n\n  theCerenkovProcess->SetTrackSecondariesFirst(true);\n  theCerenkovProcess->SetMaxBetaChangePerStep(10.0);\n  theCerenkovProcess->SetMaxNumPhotonsPerStep(MaxNumPhotons);\n\n  theParticleIterator->reset();\n  while( (*theParticleIterator)() ){\n    G4ParticleDefinition* particle = theParticleIterator->value();\n    G4ProcessManager* pmanager = particle->GetProcessManager();\n    G4String particleName = particle->GetParticleName();\n    if (theCerenkovProcess->IsApplicable(*particle)) {\n      pmanager->AddProcess(theCerenkovProcess);\n      pmanager->SetProcessOrdering(theCerenkovProcess,idxPostStep);\n    }\n  }\n}\nScintillationEvery scintillating material has a characteristic light yield, SCINTILLATIONYIELD, and an intrinsic resolution, RESOLUTIONSCALE, which generally broadens the statistical distribution of generated photons. A wider intrinsic resolution is due to impurities which are typical for doped crystals like NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl). On the other hand, the intrinsic resolution can also be narrower when the Fano factor plays a role. The actual number of emitted photons during a step fluctuates around the mean number of photons with a width given by ResolutionScale x sqrt(MeanNumberOfPhotons). The average light yield, MeanNumberOfPhotons, has a linear dependence on the local energy deposition, but it may be different for minimum ionizing and non-minimum ionizing particles.A scintillator is also characterized by its photon emission spectrum and by the exponential decay of its time spectrum. In Geant4 the scintillator can have a fast and a slow component. The relative strength of the fast component as a fraction of total scintillation yield is given by the YIELDRATIO. Scintillation may be simulated by specifying these empirical parameters for each material. It is sufficient to specify in the user’s DetectorConstruction class a relative spectral distribution as a function of photon energy for the scintillating material.// Specification of scintillation properties in DetectorConstruction.\nconst G4int NUMENTRIES = 9;\nG4double Scnt_PP[NUMENTRIES] = { 6.6*eV, 6.7*eV, 6.8*eV, 6.9*eV,\n                                 7.0*eV, 7.1*eV, 7.2*eV, 7.3*eV, 7.4*eV };\n\nG4double Scnt_FAST[NUMENTRIES] = { 0.000134, 0.004432, 0.053991, 0.241971,\n                                   0.398942, 0.000134, 0.004432, 0.053991,\n                                   0.241971 };\nG4double Scnt_SLOW[NUMENTRIES] = { 0.000010, 0.000020, 0.000030, 0.004000,\n                                   0.008000, 0.005000, 0.020000, 0.001000,\n                                   0.000010 };\n\nG4Material* Scnt;\nG4MaterialPropertiesTable* Scnt_MPT = new G4MaterialPropertiesTable();\n\nScnt_MPT->AddProperty(\"FASTCOMPONENT\", Scnt_PP, Scnt_FAST, NUMENTRIES);\nScnt_MPT->AddProperty(\"SLOWCOMPONENT\", Scnt_PP, Scnt_SLOW, NUMENTRIES);\n\nScnt_MPT->AddConstProperty(\"SCINTILLATIONYIELD\", 5000./MeV);\nScnt_MPT->AddConstProperty(\"RESOLUTIONSCALE\", 2.0);\nScnt_MPT->AddConstProperty(\"FASTTIMECONSTANT\",  1.*ns);\nScnt_MPT->AddConstProperty(\"SLOWTIMECONSTANT\", 10.*ns);\nScnt_MPT->AddConstProperty(\"YIELDRATIO\", 0.8);\n\nScnt->SetMaterialPropertiesTable(Scnt_MPT);\nIn cases where the scintillation yield of a scintillator depends on the particle type, different scintillation processes may be defined for them. How this yield scales to the one specified for the material is expressed with the ScintillationYieldFactor in the user’s PhysicsList as shown in the below. In those cases where the fast to slow excitation ratio changes with particle type, the method SetScintillationExcitationRatio can be called for each scintillation process (see the advanced underground_physics example). This overwrites the YieldRatio obtained from the G4MaterialPropertiesTable.// Implementation of the scintillation process in PhysicsList.¶\nG4Scintillation* theMuonScintProcess = new G4Scintillation(\"Scintillation\");\n\ntheMuonScintProcess->SetTrackSecondariesFirst(true);\ntheMuonScintProcess->SetScintillationYieldFactor(0.8);\n\ntheParticleIterator->reset();\nwhile( (*theParticleIterator)() ){\n  G4ParticleDefinition* particle = theParticleIterator->value();\n  G4ProcessManager* pmanager = particle->GetProcessManager();\n  G4String particleName = particle->GetParticleName();\n  if (theMuonScintProcess->IsApplicable(*particle)) {\n     if (particleName == \"mu+\") {\n        pmanager->AddProcess(theMuonScintProcess);\n        pmanager->SetProcessOrderingToLast(theMuonScintProcess, idxAtRest);\n        pmanager->SetProcessOrderingToLast(theMuonScintProcess, idxPostStep);\n     }\n  }\n}\nA Gaussian-distributed number of photons is generated according to the energy lost during the step. A resolution scale of 1.0 produces a statistical fluctuation around the average yield set with AddConstProperty(\"SCINTILLATIONYIELD\"), while values > 1 broaden the fluctuation. A value of zero produces no fluctuation. Each photon’s frequency is sampled from the empirical spectrum. The photons originate evenly along the track segment and are emitted uniformly into 4PI with a random linear polarization and at times characteristic for the scintillation component.When there are multiple scintillators in the simulation and/or when the scintillation yield is a non-linear function of the energy deposited, the user can also define an array of total scintillation light yields as a function of the energy deposited and particle type. The available particles are protons, electrons, deuterons, tritons, alphas, and carbon ions. These are the particles known to significantly effect the scintillation light yield, of for example, BC501A (NE213/EJ301) liquid organic scintillator and BC420 plastic scintillator as function of energy deposited.The method works as follows:In the user’s physics lists, the user must set a G4bool flag that allows scintillation light emission to depend on the energy deposited by particle type:theScintProcess->SetScintillationByParticleType(true);\nThe user must also specify and add, via the AddProperty method of the MPT, the scintillation light yield as function of incident particle energy with new keywords, for example: PROTONSCINTILLATIONYIELD etc. and pairs of protonEnergy and scintLightYield.Wavelength ShiftingWavelength Shifting (WLS) fibers are used in many high-energy particle physics experiments. They absorb light at one wavelength and re-emit light at a different wavelength and are used for several reasons. For one, they tend to decrease the self-absorption of the detector so that as much light reaches the PMTs as possible. WLS fibers are also used to match the emission spectrum of the detector with the input spectrum of the PMT.A WLS material is characterized by its photon absorption and photon emission spectrum and by a possible time delay between the absorption and re-emission of the photon. Wavelength Shifting may be simulated by specifying these empirical parameters for each WLS material in the simulation. It is sufficient to specify in the user’s DetectorConstruction class a relative spectral distribution as a function of photon energy for the WLS material. WLSABSLENGTH is the absorption length of the material as a function of the photon’s energy. WLSCOMPONENT is the relative emission spectrum of the material as a function of the photon’s energy, and WLSTIMECONSTANT accounts for any time delay which may occur between absorption and re-emission of the photon.// Specification of WLS properties in DetectorConstruction.\nconst G4int nEntries = 9;\n\nG4double PhotonEnergy[nEntries] = { 6.6*eV, 6.7*eV, 6.8*eV, 6.9*eV,\n                                  7.0*eV, 7.1*eV, 7.2*eV, 7.3*eV, 7.4*eV };\n\nG4double RIndexFiber[nEntries] =\n          { 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60, 1.60 };\nG4double AbsFiber[nEntries] =\n          {0.1*mm,0.2*mm,0.3*mm,0.4*cm,1.0*cm,10*cm,1.0*m,10.0*m,10.0*m};\nG4double EmissionFiber[nEntries] =\n          {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 10.0 };\n\nG4Material* WLSFiber;\nG4MaterialPropertiesTable* MPTFiber = new G4MaterialPropertiesTable();\n\nMPTFiber->AddProperty(\"RINDEX\",PhotonEnergy,RIndexFiber,nEntries);\nMPTFiber->AddProperty(\"WLSABSLENGTH\",PhotonEnergy,AbsFiber,nEntries);\nMPTFiber->AddProperty(\"WLSCOMPONENT\",PhotonEnergy,EmissionFiber,nEntries);\nMPTFiber->AddConstProperty(\"WLSTIMECONSTANT\", 0.5*ns);\n\nWLSFiber->SetMaterialPropertiesTable(MPTFiber);\nThe process is defined in the PhysicsList in the usual way. The process class name is G4OpWLS. It should be instantiated with theWLSProcess = new G4OpWLS(“OpWLS”) and attached to the process manager of the optical photon as a DiscreteProcess. The way the WLSTIMECONSTANT is used depends on the time profile method chosen by the user. If in the PhysicsList theWLSProcess->UseTimeGenerator(“exponential”) option is set, the time delay between absorption and re-emission of the photon is sampled from an exponential distribution, with the decay term equal to WLSTIMECONSTANT. If, on the other hand, theWLSProcess->UseTimeGenerator(“delta”) is chosen, the time delay is a delta function and equal to WLSTIMECONSTANT. The default is “delta” in case the G4OpWLS::UseTimeGenerator(const G4String name) method is not used.AbsorptionThe implementation of optical photon bulk absorption, G4OpAbsorption, is trivial in that the process merely kills the particle. The procedure requires the user to fill the relevant G4MaterialPropertiesTable with empirical data for the absorption length, using ABSLENGTH as the property key in the public method AddProperty. The absorption length is the average distance traveled by a photon before being absorbed by the medium; i.e. it is the mean free path returned by the GetMeanFreePath method.Rayleigh ScatteringThe differential cross section in Rayleigh scattering, dσ/dΩ, is proportional to 1+cos2θ, where θ is the polar of the new polarization vector with respect to the old polarization vector. The G4OpRayleigh scattering process samples this angle accordingly and then calculates the scattered photon’s new direction by requiring that it be perpendicular to the photon’s new polarization in such a way that the final direction, initial and final polarizations are all in one plane. This process thus depends on the particle’s polarization (spin). The photon’s polarization is a data member of the G4DynamicParticle class.A photon which is not assigned a polarization at production, either via the SetPolarization method of the G4PrimaryParticle class, or indirectly with the SetParticlePolarization method of the G4ParticleGun class, may not be Rayleigh scattered. Optical photons produced by the G4Cerenkov process have inherently a polarization perpendicular to the cone’s surface at production. Scintillation photons have a random linear polarization perpendicular to their direction.The process requires a G4MaterialPropertiesTable to be filled by the user with Rayleigh scattering length data. The Rayleigh scattering attenuation length is the average distance traveled by a photon before it is Rayleigh scattered in the medium and it is the distance returned by the GetMeanFreePath method. The G4OpRayleigh class provides a RayleighAttenuationLengthGenerator method which calculates the attenuation coefficient of a medium following the Einstein-Smoluchowski formula whose derivation requires the use of statistical mechanics, includes temperature, and depends on the isothermal compressibility of the medium. This generator is convenient when the Rayleigh attenuation length is not known from measurement but may be calculated from first principles using the above material constants. For a medium named Water and no Rayleigh scattering attenuation length specified by the user, the program automatically calls the RayleighAttenuationLengthGenerator which calculates it for 10 degrees Celsius liquid water.Mie ScatteringMie Scattering (or Mie solution) is an analytical solution of Maxwell’s equations for scattering of optical photons by spherical particles. It is significant only when the radius of the scattering object is of order of the wave length. The analytical expressions for Mie Scattering are very complicated since they are a series sum of Bessel functions. One common approximation made is call Henyey-Greenstein (HG). The implementation in Geant4 follows the HG approximation (for details see the Physics Reference Manual) and the treatment of polarization and momentum are similar to that of Rayleigh scattering. We require the final polarization direction to be perpendicular to the momentum direction. We also require the final momentum, initial polarization and final polarization to be in the same plane.The process requires a G4MaterialPropertiesTable to be filled by the user with Mie scattering length data (entered with the name: MIEHG) analogous to Rayleigh scattering. The Mie scattering attenuation length is the average distance traveled by a photon before it is Mie scattered in the medium and it is the distance returned by the GetMeanFreePath method. In practice, the user not only needs to provide the attenuation length of Mie scattering, but also needs to provide the constant parameters of the approximation: g_f, g_b, and r_f.

Prior to release 8.0, parameterisations were bound to a G4LogicalVolume, the root of a volume hierarchy. These root volumes are now attributes of the G4Region. Envelopes often correspond to the volumes of sub-detectors: electromagnetic calorimeters, tracking chambers, etc. With Geant4 it is also possible to define envelopes by overlaying a parallel or “ghost” geometry as discussed in Parameterisation Using Ghost Geometries.In Geant4, parameterisations have three main features. You must specify:the particle types for which your parameterisation is valid;\n\nthe dynamics conditions for which your parameterisation is valid and must be triggered;\n\nthe parameterisation itself: where the primary will be killed or moved, whether or not to create it or create secondaries, etc., and where the detector response will be computed.\n\nGeant4 will message your parameterisation code for each step starting in any root G4LogicalVolume (including daughters. sub-daughters, etc. of this volume) of the G4Region. It will proceed by first asking the available parameterisations for the current particle type if one of them (and only one) wants to issue a trigger. If so it will invoke its parameterisation. In this case, the tracking will not apply physics to the particle in the step. Instead, the UserSteppingAction will be invoked.Parameterisations look like a “user stepping action” but are more advanced because:parameterisation code is messaged only in the G4Region to which it is bound;\n\nparameterisation code is messaged anywhere in the G4Region , that is, any volume in which the track is located;\n\nGeant4 will provide information to your parameterisation code about the current root volume of the G4Region in which the track is travelling.\n\nOverview of Parameterisation ComponentsThe Geant4 components which allow the implementation and control of parameterisations are:G4VFastSimulationModelThis is the abstract class for the implementation of parameterisations. You must inherit from it to implement your concrete parameterisation model.\n\n\nG4FastSimulationManagerThe G4VFastSimulationModel objects are attached to the G4Region through a G4FastSimulationManager. This object will manage the list of models and will message them at tracking time.\n\n\nG4Region/EnvelopeAs mentioned before, an envelope in Geant4 is a G4Region. The parameterisation is bound to the G4Region by setting a G4FastSimulationManager pointer to it.\n\n\n\nFig.  shows how the G4VFastSimulationModel and G4FastSimulationManager objects are bound to the G4Region. Then for all root G4LogicalVolume’s held by the G4Region, the fast simulation code is active.G4FastSimulationManagerProcessThis is a G4VProcess. It provides the interface between the tracking and the parameterisation. It must be set in the process list of the particles you want to parameterise.\n\n\nG4GlobalFastSimulationManagerThis a singleton class which provides the management of the G4FastSimulationManager objects and some ghost facilities.\n\n\nThe G4VFastSimulationModel Abstract ClassConstructorsThe G4VFastSimulationModel class has two constructors. The second one allows you to get started quickly:G4VFastSimulationModel(const G4String& aName):Here aName identifies the parameterisation model.\n\n\nG4VFastSimulationModel(const G4String& aName, G4Region*, G4bool IsUnique=false):In addition to the model name, this constructor accepts a G4Region pointer. The needed G4FastSimulationManager object is constructed if necessary, passing to it the G4Region pointer and the Boolean value. If it already exists, the model is simply added to this manager. Note that the G4VFastSimulationModel object will not keep track of the G4Region passed in the constructor. The Boolean argument is there for optimization purposes: if you know that the G4Region has a unique root G4LogicalVolume, uniquely placed, you can set the Boolean value to “true”.\n\n\nVirtual methodsThe G4VFastSimulationModel has three pure virtual methods which must be overridden in your concrete class:G4VFastSimulationModel(const G4String& aName):Here aName identifies the parameterisation model.\n\n\nG4bool ModelTrigger( const G4FastTrack&):You must return “true” when the dynamic conditions to trigger your parameterisation are fulfilled. G4FastTrack provides access to the current G4Track, gives simple access to the current root G4LogicalVolume related features (its G4VSolid, and G4AffineTransform references between the global and the root G4LogicalVolume local coordinates systems) and simple access to the position and momentum expressed in the root G4LogicalVolume coordinate system. Using these quantities and the G4VSolid methods, you can for example easily check how far you are from the root G4LogicalVolume boundary.\n\n\nG4bool IsApplicable(const G4ParticleDefinition&):In your implementation, you must return “true” when your model is applicable to the G4ParticleDefinition passed to this method. The G4ParticleDefinition provides all intrinsic particle information (mass, charge, spin, name …).\n\n\nIf you want to implement a model which is valid only for certain particle types, it is recommended for efficiency that you use the static pointer of the corresponding particle classes.As an example, in a model valid for gammas only, the IsApplicable() method should take the form:#include \"G4Gamma.hh\"\n\nG4bool MyGammaModel::IsApplicable(const G4ParticleDefinition& partDef)\n{\n  return &partDef == G4Gamma::GammaDefinition();\n}\nG4bool ModelTrigger(const G4FastTrack&):You must return “true” when the dynamic conditions to trigger your parameterisation are fulfilled. The G4FastTrack provides access to the current G4Track, gives simple access to envelope related features (G4LogicalVolume, G4VSolid, and G4AffineTransform references between the global and the envelope local coordinates systems) and simple access to the position and momentum expressed in the envelope coordinate system. Using these quantities and the G4VSolid methods, you can for example easily check how far you are from the envelope boundary.\n\n\nvoid DoIt(const G4FastTrack&, G4FastStep&):The details of your parameterisation will be implemented in this method. The G4FastTrack reference provides the input information, and the final state of the particles after parameterisation must be returned through the G4FastStep reference. Tracking for the final state particles is requested after your parameterisation has been invoked.\n\n\nThe G4FastSimulationManager Class:G4FastSimulationManager functionalities regarding the use of ghost volumes are explained in Parameterisation Using Ghost Geometries.ConstructorG4FastSimulationManager(G4Region *anEnvelope, G4bool IsUnique=false):\nThis is the only constructor. You specify the G4Region by providing its pointer. The G4FastSimulationManager object will bind itself to this G4Region. If you know that this G4Region has a single root G4LogicalVolume, placed only once, you can set the IsUnique boolean to “true” to allow some optimization.Note that if you choose to use the G4VFastSimulationModel(const G4String&, G4Region*, G4bool) constructor for your model, the G4FastSimulationManager will be constructed using the given G4Region* and G4bool values of the model constructor.G4VFastSimulationModel object managementThe following two methods provide the usual management functions.void AddFastSimulationModel( G4VFastSimulationModel*)\nRemoveFastSimulationModel( G4VFastSimulationModel*)\nThe G4FastSimulationManagerProcess ClassThis G4VProcess serves as an interface between the tracking and the parameterisation. At tracking time, it collaborates with the G4FastSimulationManager of the current volume, if any, to allow the models to trigger. If no manager exists or if no model issues a trigger, the tracking goes on normally.In the present implementation, you must set this process in the G4ProcessManager of the particles you parameterise to enable your parameterisation.The processes ordering is:[n-3] ...\n[n-2] Multiple Scattering\n[n-1] G4FastSimulationManagerProcess\n[ n ] G4Transportation\nThis ordering is important if you use ghost geometries, since the G4FastSimulationManagerProcess will provide navigation in the ghost world to limit the step on ghost boundaries.The G4FastSimulationManager must be added to the process list of a particle as a continuous and discrete process if you use ghost geometries for this particle. You can add it as a discrete process if you don’t use ghosts.The following code registers the G4FastSimulationManagerProcess with all the particles as a discrete and continuous process:void MyPhysicsList::addParameterisation()\n{\n  G4FastSimulationManagerProcess*\n    theFastSimulationManagerProcess = new G4FastSimulationManagerProcess();\n  theParticleIterator->reset();\n  while( (*theParticleIterator)() )\n    {\n      G4ParticleDefinition* particle = theParticleIterator->value();\n      G4ProcessManager* pmanager = particle->GetProcessManager();\n      pmanager->AddProcess(theFastSimulationManagerProcess, -1, 0, 0);\n    }\n}\nThe G4GlobalFastSimulationManager Singleton ClassThis class is a singleton which can be accessed as follows:#include \"G4GlobalFastSimulationManager.hh\"\n//...\n//...\nG4GlobalFastSimulationManager* globalFSM;\nglobalFSM = G4GlobalFastSimulationManager::getGlobalFastSimulationManager();\n//...\n//...\n\nPresently, you will mainly need to use the GlobalFastSimulationManager if you use ghost geometries.Parameterisation Using Ghost GeometriesIn some cases, volumes of the tracking geometry do not allow envelopes to be defined. This may be the case with a geometry coming from a CAD system. Since such a geometry is flat, a parallel geometry must be used to define the envelopes.Another interesting case involves defining an envelope which groups the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters of a detector into one volume. This may be useful when parameterizing the interaction of charged pions. You will very likely not want electrons to see this envelope, which means that ghost geometries have to be organized by particle flavours.Using ghost geometries implies some more overhead in the parameterisation mechanism for the particles sensitive to ghosts, since navigation is provided in the ghost geometry by the G4FastSimulationManagerProcess. Usually, however, only a few volumes will be placed in this ghost world, so that the geometry computations will remain rather cheap.In the existing implementation (temporary implementation with G4Region but before parallel geometry implementation), you may only consider ghost G4Regions with just one root G4LogicalVolume. The G4GlobalFastSimulationManager provides the construction of the ghost geometry by making first an empty “clone” of the world for tracking provided by the construct() method of your G4VUserDetectorConstruction concrete class. You provide the placement of the G4Region root G4LogicalVolume relative to the ghost world coordinates in the G4FastSimulationManager objects. A ghost G4Region is recognized by the fact that its associated G4FastSimulationManager retains a non-empty list of placements.The G4GlobalFastSimulationManager will then use both those placements and the IsApplicable() methods of the models attached to the G4FastSimulationManager objects to build the flavour-dependent ghost geometries.Then at the beginning of the tracking of a particle, the appropriate ghost world, if any, will be selected.The steps required to build one ghost G4Region are:built the ghost G4Region : myGhostRegion;\n\nbuild the root G4LogicalVolume: myGhostLogical, set it to myGhostRegion;\n\nbuild a G4FastSimulationManager object, myGhostFSManager, giving myGhostRegion as argument of the constructor;\n\ngive to the G4FastSimulationManager the placement of the myGhostLogical, by invoking for the G4FastSimulationManager method:AddGhostPlacement(G4RotationMatrix*, const G4ThreeVector&);\n\nor:\n\nAddGhostPlacement(G4Transform3D*);\n\nwhere the rotation matrix and translation vector of the 3-D transformation describe the placement relative to the ghost world coordinates.\n\n\nbuild your G4VFastSimulationModel objects and add them to the myGhostFSManager. The IsApplicable() methods of your models will be used by the G4GlobalFastSimulationManager to build the ghost geometries corresponding to a given particle type.\nInvoke the G4GlobalFastSimulationManager method:\nG4GlobalFastSimulationManager::getGlobalFastSimulationManager()->CloseFastSimulation();\n\n\nThis last call will cause the G4GlobalFastSimulationManager to build the flavour-dependent ghost geometries. This call must be done before the RunManager closes the geometry. (It is foreseen that the run manager in the future will invoke the CloseFastSimulation() to synchronize properly with the closing of the geometry).Visualization facilities are provided for ghosts geometries. After the CloseFastSimulation() invocation, it is possible to ask for the drawing of ghosts in an interactive session. The basic commands are:/vis/draw/Ghosts particle_name\nwhich makes the drawing of the ghost geometry associated with the particle specified by name in the command line./vis/draw/Ghosts\nwhich draws all the ghost geometries.\n\n\nGflash ParameterizationThis section describes how to use the Gflash library. Gflash is a concrete parameterization which is based on the equations and parameters of the original Gflash package from H1(hep-ex/0001020, Grindhammer & Peters, see physics manual) and uses the “fast simulation” facilities of Geant4 described above. Briefly, whenever a e-/e+ particle enters the calorimeter, it is parameterized if it has a minimum energy and the shower is expected to be contained in the calorimeter (or ” parameterization envelope”). If this is fulfilled the particle is killed, as well as all secondaries, and the energy is deposited according to the Gflash equations. An example, provided in examples/extended/parametrisation/gflash/, shows how to interface Gflash to your application. The simulation time is measured, so the user can immediately see the speed increase resulting from the use of Gflash.Using the Gflash ParameterisationTo use Gflash “out of the box” the following steps are necessary:The user must add the fast simulation process to his process manager:void MyPhysicsList::addParameterisation()\n{\nG4FastSimulationManagerProcess*\ntheFastSimulationManagerProcess = new G4FastSimulationManagerProcess();\ntheParticleIterator->reset();\nwhile( (*theParticleIterator)() )\n{\nG4ParticleDefinition* particle = theParticleIterator->value();\nG4ProcessManager* pmanager = particle->GetProcessManager();\npmanager->AddProcess(theFastSimulationManagerProcess, -1, 0, 0);\n}\n}\nThe envelope in which the parameterization should be performed must be specified (below: G4Region m_calo_region) and the GFlashShowerModel must be assigned to this region. Furthermore, the classes GFlashParticleBounds (which provides thresholds for the parameterization like minimal energy etc.), GflashHitMaker(a helper class to generate hits in the sensitive detector) and GFlashHomoShowerParamterisation (which does the computations) must be constructed (by the user at the moment) and assigned to the GFlashShowerModel. Please note that at the moment only homogeneous calorimeters are supported.m_theFastShowerModel = new GFlashShowerModel(\"fastShowerModel\",m_calo_region);\nm_theParametrisation = new GFlashHomoShowerParamterisation(matManager->getMaterial(mat));\nm_theParticleBounds  = new GFlashParticleBounds();\nm_theHMaker          = new GFlashHitMaker();\nm_theFastShowerModel->SetParametrisation(*m_theParametrisation);\nm_theFastShowerModel->SetParticleBounds(*m_theParticleBounds) ;\nm_theFastShowerModel->SetHitMaker(*m_theHMaker);\nThe user must also set the material of the calorimeter, since the computation depends on the material.\n\nIt is mandatory to use G4VGFlashSensitiveDetector as (additional) base class for the sensitive detector.class ExGflashSensitiveDetector: public G4VSensitiveDetector ,public G4VGFlashSensitiveDetector\nHere it is necessary to implement a separate interface, where the GFlash spots are processed.(ProcessHits(G4GFlashSpot*aSpot ,G4TouchableHistory* ROhist))\nA separate interface is used, because the Gflash spots naturally contain less information than the full simulation.\nSince the parameters in the Gflash package are taken from fits to full simulations with Geant3, some retuning might be necessary for good agreement with Geant4 showers. For experiment-specific geometries some retuning might be necessary anyway. The tuning is quite complicated since there are many parameters (some correlated) and cannot be described here (see again hep-ex/0001020). For brave users the Gflash framework already foresees the possibility of passing a class with the (users) parameters,GVFlashHomoShowerTuning, to the GFlashHomoShowerParamterisation constructor. The default parameters are the original Gflash parameters:GFlashHomoShowerParameterisation(G4Material * aMat, GVFlashHomoShowerTuning * aPar = 0);\nNow there is also a preliminary implementation of a parameterization for sampling calorimeters.The user must specify the active and passive material, as well as the thickness of the active and passive layer.The sampling structure of the calorimeter is taken into account by using an “effective medium” to compute the shower shape.All material properties needed are calculated automatically. If tuning is required, the user can pass his own parameter set in the class GFlashSamplingShowerTuning. Here the user can also set his calorimeter resolution.All in all the constructor looks the following:GFlashSamplingShowerParamterisation(G4Material * Mat1, G4Material * Mat2,G4double d1,G4double d2, GVFlashSamplingShowerTuning * aPar = 0);\nAn implementation of some tools that should help the user to tune the parameterization is foreseen.\n\n\n"},"PhysicsProcesses/Transportation.html":{"url":"PhysicsProcesses/Transportation.html","title":"Transportation","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nTransportationhttp://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/TrackingAndPhysics/physicsProcess.html#transportation-processA Transportation process is required for every particle which is tracked in a simulation. It interfaces with the Geometry Modeller, to move a track inside the geometry by calling the G4Navigator class. In addition, if an external field (potentially Electromagnetic, but also gravity or a combination) is registered for the whole setup or inside the current volume, it calls the class (G4PropagatorInField) which integrates the equation of motion, and then intersects the curved trajectory with the geometry.Transportation comes in two flavours:the ‘standard’ G4Transportation process, used for most applications, and\n\nthe G4CoupledTransportation process, which is activated when multiple geometries are active.\n\nMultiple geometries can be created in order to cope with different use cases:when a mass overlay geometry is used to overlap a set of ‘top’ volume onto a complex existing geometry,\n\nwhen the Geant4 scoring and/or biasing capabilities are activated.\n\nThe registration of the relevant Transportation process is handled by the G4RunManager, which chooses the correct type depending on whether any of the features which require parallel geometries have been used.The G4Transportation process uses the G4Navigator of the Geant4 Geometry Modeller to obtain the distance to the next boundary along a straight line (for a neutral particle, or a charged particle in zero field.)The G4CoupledTransportation process uses the G4PathFinder class to obtain the shortest length to a boundary amongst the geometries registered for the current particle - in effect multiplexing the different geometries.In addition the transportation processes estimates the time of flight for the current step. For a neutral particle or a charged particle inside a pure magnetic field, this is estimated from the initial and final velocity of the particle. This taking into account roughly the effect of energy loss from ionisation. Since the full path length is used (rather than the geometrical one) the path lengthening due to multiple scattering is also taken into account.For a charged particle in an EM field with a non-zero electric component, or a gravity field, the time of flight is calculated taking into account the change in velocity.\n\n\n"},"class/":{"url":"class/","title":"Class","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nREADMEEM        \"gamma\",            \"e-\",           \"e+\",           \"mu+\",        \"mu-\",\n          \"pi+\",           \"pi-\",        \"kaon+\",         \"kaon-\",     \"proton\",\n  \"anti_proton\",         \"alpha\",          \"He3\",    \"GenericIon\",         \"B+\",\n           \"B-\",            \"D+\",           \"D-\",           \"Ds+\",        \"Ds-\",\n     \"anti_He3\",    \"anti_alpha\",\"anti_deuteron\",\"anti_lambda_c+\",\"anti_omega-\",\n\"anti_sigma_c+\",\"anti_sigma_c++\",  \"anti_sigma+\",   \"anti_sigma-\",\"anti_triton\",\n   \"anti_xi_c+\",      \"anti_xi-\",     \"deuteron\",     \"lambda_c+\",     \"omega-\",\n     \"sigma_c+\",     \"sigma_c++\",       \"sigma+\",        \"sigma-\",       \"tau+\",\n         \"tau-\",        \"triton\",        \"xi_c+\",           \"xi-\"\nenum G4EmTableType\n{\n  fTotal = 0,\n  fRestricted,\n  fSubRestricted,\n  fIsIonisation,\n  fIsSubIonisation,\n  fIsCrossSectionPrim\n};\n\n\n\n"},"class/G4LossTableManager.html":{"url":"class/G4LossTableManager.html","title":"G4LossTableManager*","keywords":"","body":"\n\n\nG4LossTableManagerA utility static class, responsable for the energy loss tables for each particleEnergy loss processes have to register their tables with this class.

It defines public methods which describe the behavior of a physics process.G4VProcess is the base class for all physics processes.Each physics process must implement virtual methods of G4VProcess which describe the interaction (DoIt) and determine when an interaction should occur (GPIL).In order to accommodate various types of interactions G4VProcess provides three DoIt methods:G4VParticleChange* AlongStepDoIt( const G4Track& track, const G4Step& stepData )This method is invoked while G4SteppingManager is transporting a particle through one step. \n\nThe corresponding AlongStepDoIt for each defined process is applied for every step regardless of which process produces the minimum step length. \n\nEach resulting change to the track information is recorded and accumulated in G4Step. \n\nAfter all processes have been invoked, changes due to AlongStepDoIt are applied to G4Track, including the particle relocation and the safety update. \n\nNote that after the invocation of AlongStepDoIt, the endpoint of the G4Track object is in a new volume if the step was limited by a geometric boundary. \n\nIn order to obtain information about the old volume, G4Step must be accessed, since it contains information about both endpoints of a step.\n\n\nG4VParticleChange* PostStepDoIt( const G4Track& track, const G4Step& stepData )This method is invoked at the end point of a step, only if its process has produced the minimum step length, or if the process is forced to occur. \n\nG4Track will be updated after each invocation of PostStepDoIt, in contrast to the AlongStepDoIt method.\n\n\nG4VParticleChange* AtRestDoIt( const G4Track& track, const G4Step& stepData )This method is invoked only for stopped particles, and only if its process produced the minimum step length or the process is forced to occur.\n\n\nFor each of the above DoIt methods G4VProcess provides a corresponding pure virtual GPIL method:G4double PostStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength( const G4Track& track, G4double previousStepSize, G4ForceCondition* condition )This method generates the step length allowed by its process. \n\nIt also provides a flag to force the interaction to occur regardless of its step length.\n\n\nG4double AlongStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength( const G4Track& track, G4double previousStepSize, G4double currentMinimumStep, G4double& proposedSafety, G4GPILSelection* selection )This method generates the step length allowed by its process.\n\n\nG4double AtRestGetPhysicalInteractionLength( const G4Track& track, G4ForceCondition* condition )This method generates the step length in time allowed by its process. \n\nIt also provides a flag to force the interaction to occur regardless of its step length.\n\n\nOther pure virtual methods in G4VProcess follow:virtual G4bool IsApplicable(const G4ParticleDefinition&)returns true if this process object is applicable to the particle type.\n\n\nvirtual void PreparePhysicsTable(const G4ParticleDefinition&) and\nvirtual void BuildPhysicsTable(const G4ParticleDefinition&)is messaged by the process manager, whenever cross section tables should be prepared and rebuilt due to changing cut-off values. \n\nIt is not mandatory if the process is not affected by cut-off values.\n\n\nvirtual void StartTracking() and\nvirtual void EndTracking()\nare messaged by the tracking manager at the beginning and end of tracking the current track.\n\n\nSpecialized processes may be derived from seven additional virtual base classes which are themselves derived from G4VProcess.Three of these classes are used for simple processes:G4VRestProcessProcesses using only the AtRestDoIt method.\n\nexample: neutron capture\n\n\nG4VDiscreteProcessProcesses using only the PostStepDoIt method.\n\nexample: Compton scattering, hadron inelastic interaction\n\n\nTODO 说明书这里缺一个\nThe other four classes are provided for rather complex processes:G4VContinuousDiscreteProcessProcesses using both AlongStepDoIt and PostStepDoIt methods.\n\nexample: transportation, ionisation(energy loss and delta ray)\n\n\nG4VRestDiscreteProcessProcesses using both AtRestDoIt and PostStepDoIt methods.\n\nexample: positron annihilation, decay (both in flight and at rest)\n\n\nG4VRestContinuousProcessProcesses using both AtRestDoIt and AlongStepDoIt methods.\n\n\nG4VRestContinuousDiscreteProcessProcesses using AtRestDoIt, AlongStepDoIt and PostStepDoIt methods.\n\n\nclass  //  A virtual class for physics process objects.

The “root” directory of the cross-section directory structure is accessed through an environment variable, G4PARTICLEHPDATA, which has to be set by the user. This variable has to point to the directory where the low-energy charged particle data have been installed, e.g. G4TENDL1.3 for the Geant4 release 10.3 (note that the download of this data library from the Geant4 web site is not done automatically, i.e. it must be done manually by the user):export G4PARTICLEHPDATA=/your/path/G4TENDL1.3/.It is expected that the directory $G4PARTICLEHPDATA has the following five subdirectories, corresponding to the charged particles that can be handled by the low-energy charged particle transport: Proton/, Deuteron/, Triton/, He3/, Alpha/. It is possible for the user to overwrite the default directory structure with individual environment variables pointing to custom data libraries for each particle type. This is considered an advanced/expert user feature. These directories are set by the following environment variables: G4PROTONHPDATA, for proton; G4DEUTERONHPDATA, for deuteron; G4TRITONHPDATA, for triton; G4HE3HPDATA, for He3; G4ALPHAHPDATA, for alpha. Note that if any of these variables is not defined explicitly, e.g. G4TRITONHPDATA, then the corresponding data library is expected to be a subdirectory of $G4PARTICLEHPDATA/, e.g. $G4PARTICLEHPDATA/Triton/. If instead all the above five environmental variables are set, then G4PARTICLEHPDATA does not need to be specified; even if it is set, then its value will be ignored (because the per-particle ones take precedence).一些有用工具g4tools  https://softinex.lal.in2p3.fr/https://softinex.lal.in2p3.fr/inexlib/1.8.0_1/index.htmlLLNL fission  https://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/\n\n\n"}}}
